// Package varstore holds the on-disk schema for a sparse genotype store and a
// uniform way to query genotypes regardless of which format backs them.
//
// A Parquet store is a set of three files derived from one base name. All three
// are required: the calls file alone cannot distinguish a confidently-called
// reference genotype from a position that was never assayed, which is the
// distinction Classify exists to make.
//
//	BASE.calls.parquet     one row per ALT-carrying genotype
//	BASE.sites.parquet     one row per interrogated site, sample-independent
//	BASE.regions.parquet   runs of catalog sites at which a sample was called
//
// # What a store built from a plain VCF can answer
//
// Only the variants the VCF actually contains. A plain VCF asserts nothing
// about the positions between its records: an absent base was not observed to
// be reference, it simply was not reported. So the sites catalog is the exact
// boundary of what is knowable, and a query for any locus outside it yields
// StateNotAssayed for every sample -- not StateNonCarrier.
//
// This is why the run intervals in the regions file must never be read as
// coverage. They compress a per-sample, per-site record of "this sample was
// called at these catalog sites"; the gaps between those sites are not part of
// the claim. A gVCF is different, because its reference blocks (END, MIN_DP)
// are positive statements about spans, and only such a store could answer
// off-catalog positions.
//
// The sites file cannot be reconstructed from the calls file. Taking the
// distinct loci out of the calls recovers every site only when the store holds
// the entire joint callset; over a subset of samples the sites where nobody in
// that subset carries an ALT vanish silently, and a query would then report
// "never interrogated" for a position that was in fact interrogated.

// to be in-band. Callers must test against Missing before using a value; a

// Allele counts and sample counts are deliberately both present, because they
// answer different questions and neither can be derived from the other:
//
//   - AC / AN are ALLELE counts, per the VCF convention. A 1/1 genotype
//     contributes 2 to each. They are computed from GT alone and are not
//     depth-gated, so AF is exactly AC/AN.
//   - NCarriers / NCalled / NLowDP are SAMPLE counts. A 1/1 genotype is one
//     carrier, and NCalled/NLowDP additionally reflect the --min-dp threshold
//     used at conversion.
//
// So AC >= NCarriers whenever any homozygote is present, and AN is unrelated to
// NCalled both in unit and in gating. Counts are over the samples in this
// store, not copied from the source's INFO fields, which would be wrong after
// splitting multiallelics or converting a subset of a cohort.
